What if AI could find research that doesn't exist yet?

Terra Incognita scans 6,000+ papers to detect science's blind spots — and bridges them across disciplines.

Built with @elastic_devs Agent Builder + ELSER + ES|QL.

AI finds papers. But what about the research that doesn't exist yet?

That's what Terra Incognita does. It's an autonomous agent that maps the landscape of scientific literature, detects meaningful research gaps, and proposes cross-disciplinary bridges to fill them — complete with quantitative scoring and novelty verification.

Here's a real example: When asked about Alzheimer's treatment, the agent surveyed 6,000+ papers across 6 domains and found that zwitterionic anti-fouling polymers (materials science) share the same mechanism as amyloid-beta aggregation inhibition (neuroscience) — with zero existing cross-papers. A completely unexplored intersection between two mature fields.

The tech stack:
- Elasticsearch Agent Builder for autonomous multi-step reasoning
- ELSER v2 + semantic_text for zero-config semantic search
- RRF hybrid search to surface unexpected connections
- ES|QL for cross-domain density analysis
- Self-Correction Protocol that rejects false-positive bridges
- Innovation Vacuum Index & Serendipity Probability (percentile scoring)

Existing tools search for what's known. Terra Incognita discovers what's missing.

Built for the @elastic_devs Agent Builder Hackathon.
